# Website With Video Background | HTML & CSS

- attributes of <video> html5 tag ( autoplay, controls, currentTime, loop, muted, preload...)

- object-fit: cover; ( The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container. )

- mix-blend-mode: overlay; ( The mix-blend-mode CSS property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background. )

- to get rid off the bulletpoints: 
    li {
        list-style-type: none}

- filter: invert(1); ( display black as white )

 ( The filter CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders. Properties: blur, contrast, grayscale, drop-shadow... )

 ( The invert() function inverts the samples in the input image. The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. A value of 100% is completely inverted. A value of 0% leaves the input unchanged. Values between 0% and 100% are linear multipliers on the effect. The lacuna value for interpolation is 0. )
